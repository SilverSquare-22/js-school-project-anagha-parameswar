        <div id="intro"><h2>History of Computer</h2>
        <p>The history of computer dates back to 1100 BC, when Abacus, the first calculating device, was used to perform simple arithmetic computations. About 2700 years later, at around 1614 AD, Napier's Bones was introduced, which aided with multiplication too. In 1617 AD, Slide Ruler was invented; Punch Cards in 1804, and in 1837, Charles Babbage brought forward his Analytical Engine, which was the first mechanical general purpose computer. 1850 saw the introduction of Boolean Logic, which continues to remain the foundation of Computers even today.<br>In 1927, devices like EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Calculator) and ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) were extensively used. Throughout the years 1947-51, about 20 years later, UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) was popular.<br><br>More introductions and evolution:

            <div class="num">1</div><h3>First Generation (1940-1956):</h3>
        The first generation computers used vacuum tubes for switching circuits and magnetic drums for memory. The input was given through punch cards and output was obtained through printouts.
        <br>Eg: EDVAC, ENIAC, UNIVAC</div>
        <div id="gen">
            <div class="num">2</div><h3>Second Generation (1956-1963):</h3>
        These computers replaced the bulky vacuum tubes with transistors for circuit switching and magnetic tapes for memory.
        <br>Eg: IBM 1400, UNIVAC 1107</div>
        <div id="gen">
            <div class="num">3</div><h3>Third Generation (1964-1971):</h3>
        Third generation computers made use of Integrated circuits with keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer as the mainstream input-output devices.
        <br>Eg: IBM 360, UNIVAC 1108</div>
        <div id="gen">
            <div class="num">4</div><h3>Fourth Generation (1971-Present):</h3>
        Microprocessors are used for switching circuits. Semiconductor memory such as RAM, ROM are used. This generation computers aid with complex calculations.
        <br>Eg: Apple, HP Envy</div>
        <div id="gen">
            <div class="num">5</div><h3>Fifth Generation (Present):</h3>
        This generation features Artificial Intelligence which is capable of understanding natural language. The applications include speech recognition, translation, entertainment etc. These computers are the most efficient ones in terms of speed, accuracy and reliability.</div>
